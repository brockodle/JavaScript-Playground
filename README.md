# JavaScript-Playground
See this collection and WEEP! Just kidding. In efforts to consolidate my past work into a public space, here is a collection of some of my "for fun" projects that I have done using JavaScript mainly, with some JSON and jQuery thrown in there occassionally.

I will be adding to this very soon! Lots of experiments going on right now, so stay tuned!

With hearts,
Brock
